All aircraft names in this file should correspond with naming provided in following files:

* https://github.com/pydcs/dcs/blob/master/dcs/planes.py - for planes
* https://github.com/pydcs/dcs/blob/master/dcs/helicopters.py - for helicopters
* https://github.com/pydcs/dcs/blob/master/dcs/vehicles.py - for vehicles (this include all of the ground vehicles)

You can find names at the bottom of the file in following format:

x_map = {
    "Name of the unit in game": Identifier,
}

from this example `Identifier` should be used (which may or may not include category of the unit and dot + underscore characters).
For example, player accessible Hornet is called `FA_18C_hornet`, and MANPAD Igla is called `AirDefence.MANPADS_SA_18_Igla_S_Grouse`
