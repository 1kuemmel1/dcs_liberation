## Development Guide (WIP)

Develop is the main development branch which is updated regularly.
Master branch will be updated less regularly and on release on new version. 

Other branch might be used for feature development.

**Note :**
If you have errors with pydcs object not being defined, please check that you have the latest version installed. Sometimes the dev branch will use an even more recent version of pydcs that has not been published yet, so you might want to download pydcs directly from the pydcs repository, and copy it in your Python (or virtual env) ./Libs/site-package directory.
