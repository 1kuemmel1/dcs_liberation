[DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/world/) single-player dynamic campaign. 

[Installation instructions/Manual](https://github.com/shdwp/dcs_liberation/wiki)

Inspired by *ARMA Liberation* mission.

If you plan on using code from git, and not from release archieve, you should copy the `resources/payloads` from archieve to working directory.

Uses [pydcs](http://github.com/pydcs/dcs) for mission generation.
