## Special Thanks

First, a big thanks to shdwp, for starting the original DCS Liberation project. 

Then, DCS Liberation uses [pydcs](http://github.com/pydcs/dcs) for mission generation, and nothing would be possible without this.
It also uses the popular [Mist](https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools) lua framework for mission scripting.
And for the JTAC feature, DCS Liberation embed Ciribob's JTAC Autolase [script](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-JTACAutoLaze).

Please also show some support to these projects !
