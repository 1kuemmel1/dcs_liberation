description: >-
  The F/A-18C Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter that is flown by a
  single pilot in a "glass cockpit". It combines extreme maneuverability , a
  deadly arsenal of weapons, and the ability to operate from an aircraft
  carrier. Operated by several nations, this multi-role fighter has been
  instrumental in conflicts from 1986 to today.

  The Hornet is equipped with a large suite of sensors that includes a radar,
  targeting pod, and a helmet mounted sight. In addition to its internal 20mm
  cannon, the Hornet can be armed with a large assortment of unguided bombs and
  rockets, laser and GPS-guided bombs, air-to-surface missiles of all sorts, and
  both radar and infrared-guided air-to-air missiles.

  The Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a
  dogfight. Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet is also a very easy aircraft
  to fly.
